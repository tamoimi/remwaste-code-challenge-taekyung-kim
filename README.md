### 1. Light Mode Instead of Dark Mode
For this redesign, I decided to apply a light mode instead of dark mode. The reason behind this choice is to better align with the company's image, which I feel would benefit from a brighter, more environmentally-friendly feel. Light modes tend to convey a sense of clarity, openness, and freshness—attributes I wanted to emphasize in this project. Additionally, I chose blue as the primary color to give a clean, transparent, and professional look, further enhancing the overall user experience. I believe this choice helps communicate trustworthiness and professionalism, which are key to the company’s brand.

### 2. Responsive Layout for Mobile Devices
While reviewing the design, I noticed that on mobile devices, the step navigation at the top of the page was causing horizontal scrolling due to the content being too wide. As a result, only two steps were visible, which could affect the user's experience. To address this issue, I rewrote the code to make the navigation steps responsive. Now, the number of visible steps adapts dynamically based on the device screen size, ensuring a smoother and more user-friendly experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

### 3. Skeleton Card for Improved Loading Experience
To further enhance the user experience, I added a skeleton card to the interface. This provides users with a better visual cue during loading, offering a smooth and visually appealing experience while the content is being fetched. The skeleton card helps reduce the perceived wait time and improves overall satisfaction by providing a more polished loading state.

### 4. Improved Card Selection Summary
I also improved the user experience by adding a Summary section at the bottom of the screen. Once a user selects a card, the relevant data will be displayed, providing an at-a-glance overview of the selected card. This makes it easier for customers to review their choices. Additionally, I included a close icon in the summary section for users who might find the summary obstructive. They can now easily close it to focus on other content, making the interface more flexible and user-friendly.
